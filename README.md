This is an attempt to make a world map in webgl. 
It is writen in pure javascript without the use of extrenal libraries.
It is based on a quadtree structure.

- It works on Chrome, Opera, Firefox at the moment.

Further work:
- I intend to make it work on on Edge and make som optimization to run faster.
- Rewrite the proxy from C# to Nodejs
